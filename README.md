# Boilerplate Reference Repository

A collection of reusable code snippets, algorithms, data structures, utilities, etc in multiple languages.  
Designed for quick reference and learning.

## Repository Structure

- **algorithms/** – Sorting, and searching  
- **data_structures/** – Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps  
- **utilities/** –   
- **tests/** – Example unit tests for each language  

## How to Use

1. Browse into the desired category (e.g. `algorithms/sorting/python/`).  
2. Copy the code snippet into your project.  

## Supported Languages

- Python  
- C
- C++  
- Java  
*(more can be added over time)*

## Conventions

- File naming follows each language’s common style:  
  - Python → `snake_case.py`  
  - C → `snake_case.cpp`
  - C++ → `snake_case.cpp`  
  - Java → `PascalCase.java`  
- Each file includes a header comment explaining the purpose.
